TASK DESCRIPTION:The real-time chat application is a dynamic and interactive platform designed to facilitate instant communication between users through WebSocket technology. Built using Node.js for the backend and vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, this application ensures seamless, bidirectional communication where messages are transmitted and displayed in real-time without requiring page refreshes. The backend leverages the Express framework to serve static files and manage WebSocket connections, while the frontend provides a responsive and user-friendly interface with styled message bubbles, timestamps, and a clean layout. Key features include message history persistence, preventing duplicate messages, and a modern UI with distinct visual cues for sent and received messages. The application is designed to be lightweight yet robust, making it suitable for both learning purposes and practical use in small-scale chat environments.

The development process emphasizes error prevention and user experience. The backend uses WebSocket servers to handle multiple client connections efficiently, broadcasting messages to all connected users while excluding the sender to avoid echoes. The frontend includes intuitive design elements such as a message input field, send button, and auto-scrolling chat box, all styled with CSS for a polished look. Debugging logs are incorporated throughout the code to monitor WebSocket connections and message flows, ensuring reliability. The application also addresses common issues like browser caching and network interruptions, providing a stable communication platform. Whether for educational purposes or as a foundation for more complex chat systems, this project demonstrates core concepts of real-time web applications, including event-driven programming, client-server architecture, and responsive design principles.
